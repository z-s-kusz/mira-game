# Proof of concept hypothosis:

1. I can make one static image appear as a live video feed with a moving overlay effect.
2. I can swap in another image with no loading screen or missing frames.

# Results
1. A step function with a very low opacity value got the job done.
- I think making each camera have a unique pattern will make it feel even better.
- Additionally adding a pop of noise every so often will help sell it.
- Struggling to get the image to momentarily jump out of place but I think that could be a nice glitch effect.
- Getting pngs that are actually pngs is difficult, at least doing so for free.

2. Appears to work but that might have to do with these images being on my server. Looks like
theres a few ways to do this with JS.
